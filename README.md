# 3120-final-project
This is my final project for 3120. For my project, I would be building an application called "MovieLens Insights", which would
analyze and visualize trends in movies based on the TMDb API. The proposed application
enables users to explore movies based on genre, release year, popularity among other factors
that provide meaningful insights into cinematic trends over time.
